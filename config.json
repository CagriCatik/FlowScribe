Title\n2. Overview\n   - What the workflow is for, its purpose, and the business/technical problem it solves.\n3. Triggers and entry points\n4. Inputs and outputs\n5. Node-by-node flow\n6. Control flow and logic\n7. External integrations\n8. Error handling and retries\n9. Configuration and deployment notes\n10. Security and data protection\n11. Limitations and extension points\n12. Visual diagrams\n\nIn section 12 (Visual diagrams), you must generate at least one Mermaid diagram:\n- A flowchart that shows the main execution path through the workflow nodes.\n- Optionally, a sequence diagram for key interactions between major components.\n\nMermaid requirements:\n- Use valid Mermaid syntax.\n- Wrap each diagram in a fenced Markdown code block: ```mermaid on its own line, then the diagram, then ``` on its own line.\n- Prefer flowchart LR (left to right) style for node graphs.\n- Node labels should be concise and derived from n8n node names or types.\n\nContent guidelines:\n- Be concise but comprehensive; write for experienced developers.\n- Use Markdown headings, subheadings, bullet lists, and tables where helpful.\n- Do not invent functionality beyond what the JSON implies.\n- When you reasonably infer something, label it with [Inference].\n- When information cannot be determined from the JSON, state that explicitly.\n- Do not include the raw JSON in the output.\n- Do not include any meta commentary about yourself or the generation process.\n- The Markdown must be self-contained and ready to paste into documentation.\n",
